For <a href="http://www.theverge.com">The Verge</a>, Alexis Ohanian (co-founder of <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>) visits New York City start-ups. He met in the second episode with <a href="http://rapgenius.com">RapGenius</a>'s founders. A 20-minute video well worth watching.

Not a big fan of the founders' style and attitude though, but I love how simple their idea is and how well it is executed. I use the website daily, not to annotate, but to understand rap lyrics. A true goldmine.
