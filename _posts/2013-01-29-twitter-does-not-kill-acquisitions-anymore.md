Twitter is buying <a href="http://try.crashlytics.com">Crashlytics</a>, but will not relocate the team nor will it prevent to serve its current clients.

BusinessInsider:
<blockquote>With Crashlytics and Vine, Twitter is setting a new pattern: Buying startups and leaving them alone to develop products in Twitter's safe nest.

The model here is Google's acquisition of Android and YouTube, which it ran for years as standalone divisions.

Twitter's motives may vary deal by deal. As a Crashlytics customer, it may not have wanted the startup to end up in the hands of hostile rivals like Google or Facebook, who surely wouldn't mind learning about the ins and outs of Twitter's mobile-app code.

Vine, on the other hand, seems to have simply charmed Twitter's leaders with the premise of a new art form, a video version of Twitter's 140-character tweets.

But whatever the specific reasoning to buy a company, it's very interesting that Twitter's breaking from the acquire-hire pattern of buying startups and crushing what makes them unique.</blockquote>
