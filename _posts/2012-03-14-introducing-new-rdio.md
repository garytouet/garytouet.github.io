Sorry Spotify, I'm being unfaithful. But, you're not available in Australia, so I had to find a replacement.

I'm really happy to see a change in Rdio's interface to look more like you, iTunes and Spotify with the menu panel on the left.
I have not been using Rdio for a long time, but the hassle to easily create playlists has refrained me from spending a lot of time in the app. However, one cool feature is the 'artist radio'. If you're familiar with <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a>, it should ring a bell. It is the ability to listen to a generated playlist mixing the artist and similar ones. Great way to discover new tracks!  

Unfortunately, I'm not an unlimited subscriber so I'll have to wait a bit. If you are one, here is how to try it:
<blockquote>The completely redesigned new Rdio is available on Rdio.com and the <a href="http://www.rdio.com/apps/">Rdio desktop apps</a> to all <a href="http://www.rdio.com/#/management/subscriptions/">Web and Unlimited subscribers</a>. Switch on new Rdio from the drop down menu under your name and “Try New Rdio.”</blockquote>
