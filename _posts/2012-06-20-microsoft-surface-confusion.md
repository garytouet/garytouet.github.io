The Verge on the two different models released by Microsoft:
<blockquote>As we said, Microsoft revealed a pair of tablets today: one that runs the full Windows 8 desktop operating system, and one that runs Windows RT, a cut-down version of Windows 8 that still has Office and a desktop mode, but can't use legacy x86 software. As such, you can expect the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/products/surface-for-windows-8-pro/5800">Surface for Windows 8 Pro</a> to come with a Intel Ivy Bridge processor, but the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/products/surface-for-windows-rt/5799">Surface for Windows RT</a> will have an ARM-based chip from Nvidia, likely the same Tegra 3 that's expected to appear in <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/4/3062235/asus-tablet-600-windows-rt-tablet-windows-8">Asus' Tablet 600</a>. 

[â€¦]

That said, the two machines are actually quite a bit different when you look at their spec sheets closely. The Windows RT tablet is an incredible 9.3mm thick and weighs just 1.5 pounds, but the Windows 8 Pro version clocks in at nearly 2 pounds and 13.5mm thick. You get some extra functionality in that bargain, though: while the Windows RT version only has an "HD" display, a microSD slot, 32GB or 64GB of storage and USB 2.0, the Windows 8 Pro version bumps up the resolution to "full HD," upgrades the ports to microSDXC, USB 3.0, and Mini DisplayPort, and starts with 64GB of storage along with a 128GB option. Oh, and don't forget legacy app support.</blockquote>

The two devices have exactly the same name "Surface", but they are actually different. They not only differ in color, storage or size, but on the type of OS they run, but in the number of ports, the technology of these ports, storage and quality of the display. Am I the only one being confused? 

I'm curious to see how Microsoft is going to market the two: consumer Surface vs. pro Surface?

If not, good luck explaining this to consumers.
