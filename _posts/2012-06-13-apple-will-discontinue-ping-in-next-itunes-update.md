AllThingsD:
<blockquote>Sources close to the company say that Ping, which still exists today in iTunes 10.6.3 and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/06/12/pings-future">the iOS 6 beta — where it doesn’t work</a>, will be gone with the software’s next major release, likely scheduled for this fall. And at that point Apple’s social networking offerings will shift to Twitter and new partner Facebook entirely.</blockquote>

I remember signing up for Ping. I was interested by the idea, but with time my excitement faded. Most of my friends do not buy music on iTunes so the recommendation system was useless. I use other services to discover new tracks so Ping was not my go-to service for this. And finally, I don't like to browse the iTunes Store. It's cumbersome and slow so I was not looking forward to check my Ping account.
