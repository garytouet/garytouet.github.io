Don Melton:
<blockquote>Not only was I tasked by Scott Forstall with building a browser and building a team to build that browser, I had to keep the whole damn project a secret. Which, by the way, really complicated the shit out of hiring most of the original team since I couldnâ€™t tell them what they were working on until they took the job.</blockquote>

Don Melton then explains how secret the actual development had to be kept. I don't want to spoil it for you. It's a good story though. It's about the stress and hacks teams have to go through when building a secret product, here it's at Apple, but it may be at any other company. A piece of history.
