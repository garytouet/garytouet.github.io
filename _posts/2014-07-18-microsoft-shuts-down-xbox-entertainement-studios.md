I was curious to see what this division could do <a href="http://garytouet.com/2014/04/microsoft-produce-own-interactive-tv-shows/">back in April</a>. Six series were reported to be in the line-up. The shut-down does not impact them, but we won't see anything else from the studio. This is part of <a href="http://garytouet.com/2014/04/microsoft-produce-own-interactive-tv-shows/">the 18,000 job cuts plan announced today</a>.
	
Re/code has several details:
<blockquote>Xbox Entertainment Studios fit with Microsoft’s plan to dominate the living room through its game console. But the unit has struggled to deliver on its promise.

Sources paint a picture of a disorganized studio that struggled to close deals and lacked a fully fleshed-out business model. This inability to execute has turned off potential studio partners, they say, complicating the process of securing premium content.</blockquote>

Because of slow Xbox One sales, the studio probably did not seem like a good idea anymore:
<blockquote>Microsoft has moved away from positioning the Xbox One as an all-in-one entertainment system — a message that appeared to alienate gamers who are the most likely first buyers of a new game system. At this year’s E3 game industry trade show in Los Angeles, it was all about the games.</blockquote>

Yes, you buy a gaming console to play games. It's nice if you can stream TV or buy/rent other content, but you bought the console because it can play good games otherwise you would have bought an Apple TV.
