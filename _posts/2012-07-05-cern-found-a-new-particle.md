Jeff Blagdon for The Verge:
<blockquote>Scientists at CERN say they've found a new particle consistent with the Standard Model Higgs boson with 5-sigma certainty — a false positive probability of about 1 in 9 trillion. [...] CMS spokesperson Joe Incandela explains, "this is indeed a new particle. We know it must be a boson and it’s the heaviest boson ever found."
[...]
The Higgs mechanism explains how particles come to acquire mass, and the Higgs Boson's discovery would confirm that the mechanism is at work.</blockquote>

The CERN has not actually found the Higgs Boson, but it found a new particle. It needs to carry out further studies to determine if this particle is the boson theorised by Higgs and his colleagues. We'll know more in the coming years, but it is exciting since it could explain what gives weight to anything, if I understand well.
