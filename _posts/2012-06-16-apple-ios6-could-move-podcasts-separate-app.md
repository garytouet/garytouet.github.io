Peter Kafka:
<blockquote>People familiar with Appleâ€™s plans tell me that when its new iOS 6 software becomes widely available this fall, podcasts will have their own app, where users will be able to discover, download and play them on mobile devices. Users who access iTunes via laptop and desktop machines will still find them in that version of iTunes, though.</blockquote>

If real, this could be a good promotion for podcasts. They would no longer be considered as a standard audio file in the music app. Instead, the category will have a place of its own.

I could boost podcasts use for new users too, who may wonder what this app is for and be tempted to find out more.
