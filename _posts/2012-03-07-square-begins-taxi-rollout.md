This is an impressive achievement for Square. Their payment system will be introduced in 30 New York cabs in the coming weeks. This could become a stable stream of revenues for Square and more importantly a real-life showcase of their product to a lot of people in the most influential city in the world.

The experience seems way better than the current one and <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/459734-Checker-Passenger/attachments/29121">looks</a> <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/459732-Checker-Driver/attachments/29116">great</a>:
<blockquote>The new system, which will be in 30 taxis to start, will allow passengers to swipe their credit card at any point in the ride, before the trip has ended. There is no need to sign pieces of paper either; passengers can sign the screen in the back of the cab with their finger and then have a receipt sent to their phone by e-mail or text message.

Instead of the traditional blaring screens, these taxis will be outfitted with Square’s latest hardware — an iPad encased in a black metal sleeve that is connected to a credit card swiper. The screen displays a slick Apple-like design of New York too, showing information about your location, fare and route.</blockquote>

Exciting company to work for, no doubt!
