You can now read comfortably garytouet.com on your smartphone or tablet. I've made a couple of changes so the design adapts to the size of your device. It should make it easier for you to read: no need to zoom, no horizontal scrolling. 

I have not been able to test the site on many devices. Please let me know if you spot any bug or if you encounter any issue, I'll do my best to fix it.

You can reach me on <a href="http://twitter.com/garytouet">twitter</a> if necessary. I hope you'll enjoy the improvement.
