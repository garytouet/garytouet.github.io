Sunday night at the Coachella Festival, the crowd could hear Tupac Shakur shout "What the fuck is that Coachella?"

<a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1683173/tupac-hologram-coachella.jhtml">MTV News</a> has a few details about what was Dr. Dre's idea:

<blockquote>The Tupac hologram was several months in the planning and took nearly four months to create in a studio and though Smith was not able to reveal the exact price tag for the illusion, he said a comparable one could cost anywhere from $100,000 to more than $400,000 to pull off. "I can't say how much that event cost, but I can say it's affordable in the sense that if we had to bring entertainers around world and create concerts across the country, we could put [artists] in every venue in the country," he said.</blockquote>

It looks so good. You can discuss the real interest of this kind of performance, but you can't deny how impressive this technology is.
