Mike Skinner is a producer now, I'm sure you know that. He is half of the D.O.T with Rob Harvey. Yesterday, the group has released their first single "Bad News" featuring Elro. You should at least give it a listen. 

And if you want to know more about Elro, you should watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ZZ9zF_4bHg0">this</a>: magistral.
