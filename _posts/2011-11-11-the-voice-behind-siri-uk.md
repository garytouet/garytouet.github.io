Interesting thing is how his voiced is used for Siri:
<blockquote>“I did a set of recordings with Scansoft five or six years ago, for text-to-speech services,” says Briggs. “Five thousand sentences over three weeks, spoken in a very particular way and only reading flat and even. Then they go away and take all the phonics apart, because I have to be able to read anything you want, even if I’ve never actually recorded all those words.”</blockquote>

The guy is also the voice of satnavs for Garmin, TomTom, Jaguar, Land Rover, Audi and Porsche.
