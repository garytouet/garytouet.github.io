When I go for walks, long sitting sessions on the beach or when I feel anxious even about going out and meeting up with my friends, I always feel terrible and guilty. 

When I see people managing their time so they can spend the least by themselves, I always wish I could do the same. I very often question my taste for solitude and hope for change, but during a big social event, I always feel overwhelmed by the energy I need to deploy. It always feels like I am running faster than my pace, making an effort and eventually being out of breath. Then, I can't help but promise my brain a break far from the social overload.

Even if things have improved a little in Sydney, from time to time, it feels good to know that I'm not the only one feeling like this. For that reason if you're an introvert, Susan Cain's talk is well worth watching. For the extroverts who do not want to miss out on a good talk about their introvert brothers, that's also twenty minutes well spent.
