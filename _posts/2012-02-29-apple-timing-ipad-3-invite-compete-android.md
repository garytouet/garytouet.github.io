Cult of Mac points out something I did not realize. Guess what?
<blockquote>Apple usually sends out invites exactly 7 days before the date of a keynote, but today they broke tradition and sent the invites out 8 days before the event just to screw with Google.</blockquote>

So what is the reason here?

<blockquote>Right as Google’s Eric Schmidt was taking the stage at Mobile World Conference to talk about how awesome his company’s Android platform is, Apple completely distracted the entire internet by sending out invitations to their iPad 3 event.</blockquote>

Generate more press than Google, that's Apple's answer to Eric Schmidt's praises of Android.
