This new film is about two old-school salesmen, who find an internship at Google, and battle with young and savvy geniuses to get recruited.

Dieter Bohn for The Verge warns us:
<blockquote>It’s incredibly difficult to watch The Internship as simply a movie and not as a two-hour long recruitment ad designed to congeal the vaguely warm feelings most people harbor for the company into a wet pap of "Googly" propaganda. You can watch The Internship as the classic buddy comedy it tries to be — but you shouldn't.</blockquote>
