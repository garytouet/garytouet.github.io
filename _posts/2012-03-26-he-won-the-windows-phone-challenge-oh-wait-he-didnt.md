It was not the first time <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQjGe53zw6w">a Windows Phone got smoked by an Android phone</a>, but this time Microsoft was a poor loser.

That's a shame when your marketing campaign invites users to challenge your staff in what you would expect to be a fair comeptition.


Note that the game was crooked right from the beginning when Microsoft's staff made sure Sahas hadn't pre-loaded any app. Guess who did pre-load two weather widgets precisely set up for two different locations?

Update: Microsoft quickly replied inviting Sahas for a rematch. Fair enoughâ€¦
