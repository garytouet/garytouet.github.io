Among all the different rumors about tomorrow's Apple Keynote, the only one that excites my curiosity is a 3G connection given to the iPod Touch.

I hardly use my phone every month. I always have spare credit. Therefore an iPhone and a plan with voice and SMS do not really matter to me.

But, I must say that a little data plan would make me do the jump. Having all the power of the iPhone (internet + apps), without the less interesting stuff (calls + SMS) would delight me.

Wait and see.
