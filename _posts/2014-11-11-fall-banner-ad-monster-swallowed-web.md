Farhad Manjoo for the New York Times:
<blockquote>These days, finally, the banner ad is in decline. That is because the web, the medium in which it has thrived, is also in decline. Today we live in a mobile, social world, spending most of our time online using apps that load faster and are much prettier and more useful than websites. Instead of banners, many of these apps, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, make money through ads that appear in users’ social feeds, rather than off to the side of the page.

But what’s so bad about banners?

For one, they have ruined the appearance and usability of the web, covering every available pixel of every page with clunky bits of sponsorship. More than that, banner ads perverted the content itself. Because they are so ineffective, banner ads are sold at low prices for high volume, which means to make any money from them, sites need to pull in major traffic. This business model instilled the idea that page views were a paramount goal of the web, thus spawning millions of low-rent, me-too sites bent on getting your click.

Finally, there is privacy. Behind just about every banner ad is a vast infrastructure designed to track your movements across the web to improve the effectiveness of ads that, according to <a href="http://www.adotas.com/2013/03/study-86-of-consumers-suffer-from-banner-blindness/" title="Study: 86% Of Consumers Suffer From Banner Blindness">several studies</a>, most of us never view anyway.</blockquote>

Manjoo describes clearly why banner ads are declining. I can't believe I still meet people who swear by them and cannot consider a campaign without them nowadays.
