Peter Gelling, for the GlobalPost, as an introduction to his article:
<blockquote>This is satire. Although the news is real, very little actual reporting was done for this story and the quotes are imagined. It is the first installment of an ongoing series that examines the language journalists use to cover foreign countries. What if we wrote that way about the United States?</blockquote>

Brilliant exercise. Very well done. Not sure though what in this story is satire.
