Ars Technica:	
<blockquote>French researchers at <a href="http://www.grenoble-inp.fr/">Institut Polytechnique de Grenoble</a>, in cooperation with the <a href="http://www.webctp.com/">Centre Technique du Papier</a>, have developed a wallpaper that <a href="http://www.linformaticien.com/actualites/id/24723/un-papier-peint-pour-proteger-son-wi-fi.aspx">can block WiFi signals</a>, preventing them from being broadcast beyond the confines of an office or apartment.  But unlike other signal-blocking technologies based on the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=897177">Faraday cage</a> (which block all electromagnetic radiation), the wallpaper only blocks a select set of frequencies used by wireless LANs, and allows cellular phones and other radio waves through.</blockquote>

Apparently, you'll be able to use a classic wallpaper on top of it for a better look. 

I hope anti-wifi carpets and ceiling paint are in progress.
