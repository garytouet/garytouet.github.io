TorrentFreak details how file-sharing is getting organised after the latest SOPA and Megaupload episodes. The biggest concern now for sharers is to build the network with the least vulnerabilities. The goal is ultimately to prevent big corporations and governments to have any sort of control on it.

RetroShare is probably the best attempt: 
<blockquote>The RetroShare network allows people to create a private and encrypted file-sharing network. Users add friends by exchanging PGP certificates with people they trust. All the communication is encrypted using OpenSSL and files that are downloaded from strangers always go through a trusted friend.

In other words, itâ€™s a true Darknet and virtually impossible to monitor by outsiders.</blockquote>

This is what the entertainment industry should have considered before trying to lock everything down.
