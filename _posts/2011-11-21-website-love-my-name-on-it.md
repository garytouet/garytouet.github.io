This is a beautiful website by Harry Harrison that you need to visit.

He is definitely a very creative guy. He is the one who brought us <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/36921-HIP">these minimal pixel characters</a>. A shame that he never got <a href="http://ha.reesun.me/=/Ramblings/SupportTheSource">the credit he deserved</a>.
