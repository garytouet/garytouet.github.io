The Verge:
<blockquote>Elon Musk's SpaceX has had plenty of memorable milestones, not the least of which came in 2012 when its Dragon spacecraft become the first commercial vehicle to dock with the International Space Station. Of course, that was just the beginning for SpaceX — Musk is nothing if not ambitious — and the company's next goal is to tackle manned space flight.

Last night at its Hawthorne, California headquarters, SpaceX unveiled its newest capsule, the Dragon V2. </blockquote>
