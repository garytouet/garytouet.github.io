Keith Rabois, Square's COO, in an interview for Business Insider:
<blockquote>BI: Have you guys done any advertising? 

KR: We occasionally test advertising in different channels but the primary driver of the Square option is actually seeing Square in the real word.

BI: So no sales force.

KR: No sales force, none whatsoever. We have bought an online ad here and there but not in any serious sense.</blockquote>

As a reminder, Square has more than 1 million customers and is processing about $4 billion in payments per year. All of this mainly thanks to word-of-mouth. Crazy!
