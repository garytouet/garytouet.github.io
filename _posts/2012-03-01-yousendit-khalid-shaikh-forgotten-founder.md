Very long piece by Burt Helm for Inc.com narrating YouSendIt's troubled early stages:
<blockquote>The story of why—how a talented young entrepreneur turned on the company he worked so hard to help create—is at once bizarre and weirdly typical in the world of Silicon Valley tech start-ups.</blockquote>
It's all about friendships, trust, power and money. That's worth reading if you have the time and some popcorn around. It's a bit romanesque sometimes, but it makes the read more enjoyable.

Anyway this is a pretty tragic story explaining how a founder can see his dream being stolen and lose what he has put some much effort into.     

The biggest lesson, I guess, is not giving up ownership when accepting money from investors.
