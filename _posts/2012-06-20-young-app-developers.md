The Wall Street Journal:
<blockquote>This year, Apple opened up its developers event for the first time to 13- to 17-year-olds. The Cupertino, Calif., company supplied 150 teens with scholarships to cover the event's $1,599 entrance fee, arranged a student lounge with beanbag chairs and Skittles, and invited their parents to chaperone. The teens, or their parents, still had to sign Apple's customary nondisclosure agreements.</blockquote>

I'm fascinated by these teens would taught themselves how to code and for whom releasing apps is natural.
