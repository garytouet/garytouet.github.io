A few thoughts:
<ul>
<li>It seemed like a long keynote to me, close to two hours. They showed a lot of stuff.</li>
<li>I was surprised by the Mac Pro sneak peak and the announced release of iOS 7 later this fall. Maybe they did it in the past, but I remember Apple announcing products going for sale in the very near future. Here, they made two major announcements way ahead of release without no precise release dates. I think they're obviously addressing the recent media's and Wall Street's claims about their lack of innovation.</li>
<li>On that note, I loved Schiller's "Can't innovate anymore, my ass!". I guess he is going to take a lot heat for that.</li>
<li>The atmosphere on stage was relieved, very humorous.</li>
<li> <a href="https://twitter.com/garytouet/status/344159523096903681">I could not help but think about Scott Forstall</a> when Federighi cracked his jokes about the torn-off pages in the Calendar app, stitches, the green marker felt in Game Center. <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/09/11/apples-designers-clashing-over-tacky-software-skeuomorphisms/">He and Steve Jobs were big supporters of such graphic elements</a>. The new user interface surely is polarising. Many will say it is inspired by Windows Metro. I agree. This is a big change for iOS. I am impatient to try it out.</li>
</ul>

Apple still is the only company that can make me sit for a two-hour keynote and bring me so such enjoyment.
