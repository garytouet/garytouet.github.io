Drew Olanoff reports on The Next Web:
<blockquote>According to TheDomains, 21,054 domains were transferred away from Go Daddy on Friday alone. At $6.99 a pop, that would make for a loss of $147,167, not taking future renewals into account. The day before wasnâ€™t a good one for the company either, with 15,000 people taking their domains elsewhere. That means that even though Go Daddy changed its stance, people have had enough.</blockquote>

Perfect follow-up to my <a href="http://garytouet.com/2011/12/godaddy-sopa-bill/">previous article</a>.

I'm glad people are deciding to sanction companies who take bad decisions for the users. All the domains lost are a strong punishment for GoDaddy and a good example of Internet reactivity.

<strong>Update:</strong> Smart move from <a href="http://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>, which is using Twitter's promoted tweets to push SOPA opponents to switch to its domain registration and web hosting services. Please remark the witty coupon code: 'BYEBYEGD'.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>We're very much against SOPA. If you'd like to move to Namecheap, use transfer coupon code BYEBYEGD today (expires 12/31).</p>&mdash; Namecheap.com (@namecheap) <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Namecheap/status/149913720712204291" data-datetime="2011-12-23T20:21:07+00:00">December 23, 2011</a></blockquote>
