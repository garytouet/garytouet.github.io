Interesting short documentary by Hamish Stephenson about online's influence over creativity. Interviewees are from the fashion world. I'm not used to posting about fashion and creativity here, but it is relevant because it looks at digital influence and how these kids can become influential with an Instagram and Twitter account. The question then is how can they use this influence to make a career?
