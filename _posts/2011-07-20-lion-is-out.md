The new version of Apple's operating system is out and for the first time only available on download on the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-lion/id444303913?mt=12&ls=1">Mac App Store</a> (â‚¬23.99 or $29.99).

I'll probably wait a few days to be sure all the applications I use get updated and to let people face any bug that could come.

Lion is out, just so you know.
