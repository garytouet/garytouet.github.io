Bloomberg:
<blockquote>Fiserv, which has 16,000 clients, will announce today a black attachment called SpotPay that lets iPhones and iPads accept credit and debit cards, and deposit checks into bank accounts, Rahul Gupta, group president of digital channels at Fiserv, said in an interview.</blockquote>

The service will be pushed by banks to their customers running a business. It could be convincing for non-tech saavy business owners, who are more inclined to trust the bank rep for such operations.
