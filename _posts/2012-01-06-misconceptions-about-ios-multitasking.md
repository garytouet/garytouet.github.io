A myth busted by Fraser Speirs:
<blockquote>Let me be as clear as I can be: <strong>the iOS multitasking bar does not contain "a list of all running apps". It contains "a list of recently used apps". The user never has to manage background tasks on iOS.</strong></blockquote>

So iOS users do not need to manually quit the apps in the multitasking bar. This is useless since iOS has been built to manage it for the user. Fraser is explaining this very well in his article that I recommend you to read. Very interesting.

It took three years to Apple to bring multitasking to iOS. Remember it arrived with iOS 4.0 in 2010, but at least they took the time to make it smart and painless for the user.

What technology should be.
