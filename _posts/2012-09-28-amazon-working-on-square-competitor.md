Techcrunch:
<blockquote>Itâ€™s no secret that Amazon has been <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/20/us-walmart-amazon-kindle-idUSBRE88J0WA20120920">eying</a> the in-store physical, retail world. The company is reportedly looking to launch a number of retail stores. A credit card processor and mobile payments device could power payments at these stores.</blockquote>

The competition could get even tougher with Amazon entering the mobile payments market. It is only a rumor though, nothing has been announced yet.

It seems Square's choice to focus on design and user experience could make the difference.
