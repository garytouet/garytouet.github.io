Techcrunch:
<blockquote><a href="http://www.blackberry.com/">BlackBerry</a>, the embattled Canada-based handset maker, today finally called a spade a spade. The company halted trading in its shares to <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/blackberry-board-of-directors-announces-exploration-of-strategic-alternatives-2013-08-12-71735844">announce</a> what some might argue was inevitable: the company says it is now exploring strategic alternatives, including a possible sale or JV or other partnership. A committee chaired by Timothy Dattels and including CEO Thorsten Heins, along with Barbara Stymiest, Richard Lynch and Bert Nordberg, has been formed to look for alternatives.</blockquote>
