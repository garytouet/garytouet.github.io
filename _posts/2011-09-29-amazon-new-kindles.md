<blockquote>We are excited to announce four new products: the all-new Kindle for only $79, two new touch Kindles – Kindle Touch and Kindle Touch 3G – for $99 and $149, and a new class of Kindle – Kindle Fire – a beautiful full color Kindle for movies, TV shows, music, books, magazines, apps, games, web browsing and more, for only $199.</blockquote>

My <a href="http://garytouet.com/2011/09/amazon-unveil-kindle-fire/">impatience</a> comes to an end. Amazon finally announced its Kindle Fire.
The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051VVOB2/ref=famstripe_kf">new lineup</a> is quite confusing, but it is very cheap.

The Kindle Touch is really appealing to me: simple design, touchscreen, awesome e-ink technology, small price. 

However, I do not consider the new Kindle Fire for the moment. It is another device with a glowing screen, which my eyes struggle to bear after many hours unfortunately. If I had one, I would use my tablet to read most of the times, probably not books but loads of articles for sure. I would like to do so, but with the peace-of-mind and non-aggressive light given by the book so the Kindle Touch seems to be a better choice.
