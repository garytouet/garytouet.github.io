Rob Siltanen, creative director and managing partner at TBWA/Chiat/Day recalls Steve Jobs' words at their first meeting, the one that would lead to the creation of the 'Think Different' campaign:
<blockquote>He said, “I’m thinking no TV ads, just some print ads in the computer magazines until we get things figured out.” Clow [<em>Rob's partner</em>] remained his cool, reserved self at this point, while I found Jobs to be far more bossy and arrogant than I imagined. I got the impression he felt we were just another company lucky to be in his presence. I also didn’t agree at all with his gameplan. I chimed in and told him, “Half the world thinks Apple is going to die. A few print ads in the computer magazines aren’t going to do anything for you. You need to show the world that Apple is as strong as a lion. Nobody stands around the water cooler talking about print ads. You need to do something bigger and bolder. You need to do TV and other things that are going to give you true momentum.”</blockquote>

Steve Jobs hasn't done everything all by himself. He had talented people around him who contributed a lot to Apple's success. This a great read diving into the creation of the 'Think Different' campaign.
