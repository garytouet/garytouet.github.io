A small collection of old pictures whose subjects are the innovators of Silicon Valley. It is interesting for the little pieces of insight below each of them.

They are taken from <em>Fearless Genius</em>, a project by photographer Doug Menuez. He followed Steve Jobs for more than 3 years starting in 1985 when starting up NeXT. As a result, other tech CEO's opened their doors to him and he has been able to capture the early days of the digital revolution. 

This webpage is only a teaser to Doug Menuez's wider project, which involves a documentary, TV/Web series, education program and more. You can learn more about it on <a href="http://www.fearlessgenius.org/" title="Fearless Genius">fearlessgenius.org</a>.
