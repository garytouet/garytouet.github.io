This is it. One week before the event Apple sends the invites out and therefore notifies the public. I guess one week is enough for the journalists to get prepared and short enough for the excitement to be at its peak at the event.

Looking at the sharpness of the graphics on <a href="http://cdn.loopinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/mainimage_us1.jpg">the invite</a>, it seems fairly accurate that the iPad 3 will have a Retina Display.
