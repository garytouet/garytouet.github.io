The New York Times has an interesting article on Zuckerberg and the Facebook story. It is mind-blowing to read about his success and future challenges. He is so young and he built a giant.

<blockquote>The outlines of the Zuckerberg story thus far — the boyhood in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., the Harvard wars over “thefacebook,” the relentless rise in Silicon Valley — are by now well known. But Facebook’s I.P.O. will begin a new chapter — indeed, a new volume — in one of the great business narratives of our time. It will also make Mr. Zuckerberg almost impossibly rich. In an instant, his stake could be worth upward of $18.7 billion.</blockquote>

It's a good before-bed Sunday story to read.
