Nothing sure here, but interesting bet:
<blockquote>Apple will become a trillion-dollar company based not on iPads and Apple TV, but payments. 

Imagine taking out your iPhone and instead of buying Angry Birds you bought the latest Groupon. </blockquote>

It makes sense when you look at the number of cards info Apple has, the habit people have of paying for music, apps on their iPhones and the change payments are seeing with <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a> for example.

It can be a good marketing argument to sell more iDevices to consumers for Apple, but aren't payments delicate operations to manage? Is it worth the risk for Apple? Time will tell.
