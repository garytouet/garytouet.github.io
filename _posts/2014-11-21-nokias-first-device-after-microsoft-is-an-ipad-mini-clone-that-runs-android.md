The Verge:
<blockquote>The only things missing here to complete the iPad mini look are a home button, chamfered edges, and an Apple logo. There’s even &quot;Natural Aluminum&quot; and &quot;Lava Grey&quot; color schemes, and a cover that looks suspiciously similar to Apple’s Smart Case. Nokia's own <a href="http://n1.nokia.com/" title="Nokia N1">N1 website</a> also looks like it's straight from <a href="http://www.apple.com/" title="Apple.com">Apple.com</a>. Other specifications include a 2.4GHz quad-core Intel Atom Z3580 processor, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage. Nokia’s N1 also has an 8-megapixel camera at the rear, and a 5-megapixel version at the front.</blockquote>

Shameless design from Nokia.
