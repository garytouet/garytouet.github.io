Good news, but <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/us/white-house-says-it-opposes-parts-of-2-antipiracy-bills.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all">as the New York Times reports</a>:
<blockquote>The statement did not threaten a presidential veto, but it made plain what types of piracy enforcement measures the White House would not accept.</blockquote>

The White House seems to understand what's happening, but it's not over yet.

Side note: The White House has a <a href="https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petition-tool/">website</a> for citizens to post petitions to address important issues. I know it's guaranteed by the <a href="https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petition-tool/how-why/introduction">First Amendment of the United States Constitution</a>, but it feels very modern to me. Maybe we'll have that in France in five years time.
