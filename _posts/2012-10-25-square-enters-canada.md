CBC:
<blockquote>Dorsey, the company's co-founder and CEO, says there were a number of reasons to make Canada Square's first foray outside the United States, including relationships with banking partners that made it easier to get up and running here quickly.</blockquote>

In light of this, it definitely makes more sense than to enter the UK (<a href="http://garytouet.com/2012/09/square-has-closed-a-new-round-of-funding/">bad guess</a>). I still think it would be the easiest market to enter in Europe though, but I don't know how compliant the banks would be there.

Anyway, it's pretty cool to see that the first language supported by Square other than English is <a href="https://squareup.com/ca/fr">French</a>.
