Alexis Ohanian in an interview by Christine Lagorio:
<blockquote>We built Reddit in three weeks. It was just Web links and text submitted by users, with Interesting or Uninteresting buttons that you could click on underneath. Simple: That's all it was. After a contentious debate, we added Comments. We knew our business was in our user base, that that was the most important part.</blockquote>

Fascinating how something simply done can have such an impact.
