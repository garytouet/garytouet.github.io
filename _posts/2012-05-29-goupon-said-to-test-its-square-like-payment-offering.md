Rocky Agrawal for VentureBeat:
<blockquote>The pricing is extremely aggressive, with a 1.8% transaction fee and a 15 cent per transaction charge for transactions processed through the terminal. Square charges 2.75% with no per transaction fee. PayPal Here and Verifone Sail charge 2.7%, also with no transaction fee. Groupon is charging 2.3% for AmEx transactions <strong>[update</strong>: a groupon insider tells me the AmEx pricing is 2.7, not 2.3<strong>]</strong>. Square and PayPal don’t charge extra, and Sail charges 3.7% for AmEx.

Unlike the other players, Groupon is offering an iPod Touch and card reader to merchants free of charge. (The others provide only the readers for free […].)</blockquote>

It's still in testing phase apparently and it has not been confirmed by Groupon yet. If it is, this will be an aggressive move. 

Square is being attacked by a lot of companies. I guess, it should stay focused on its product and make sure it is the easiest to use.

The start-up seems to be ahead of the competition for the moment, because it is also focused on the customer, not only on the merchant by providing low transaction fees. <a href="https://squareup.com/pay-with-square">Pay With Square</a>, an iOS and Android app, lets the customer pay <a href="https://vimeo.com/38194167">just by saying its name</a> and <a href="https://squareup.com/pay-with-square">offers other great perks</a>. The user experience is awesome.

The combination of both apps is much stronger for a merchant than just a lower transaction fee. Satisfied users are more likely to only shop at Square-compatible locations and therefore to be more loyal. This will result in more revenues for a merchant, in the long run, than the few cents saved on transaction fees.

Groupon won't win the race if it does not propose something more compelling.
