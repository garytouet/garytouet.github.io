It's impossible for me to select one of them. They are all worth reading and worth remembering.

By curiosity, I took this <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes2.asp">Myers-Briggs test</a> again today, which will give a good idea of what kind of introvert or extrovert you are. The result is still introvert for me (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTJ">INTJ</a>) even if I would say that I changed a bit since the last time I took it.

I don't value this conclusion too much, but reading about introverts is helpful. Things that I find abnormal about me, especially when it comes to relationships with people, look a bit less unordinary.
