Flume is a young Sydney-based artist and I like every single track from this guy, which is rare. I recommend you to check his <a href="http://soundcloud.com/flume-1/">other tracks</a> out, in particular his remixes of '<a href="http://soundcloud.com/flume-1/orna-the-anthem-flume-remix">Orna - The Anthem</a>' and '<a href="http://soundcloud.com/flume-1/hyperparadise-flume-remix">Hermitude - HyperParadise</a>'.

Good luck to him.
