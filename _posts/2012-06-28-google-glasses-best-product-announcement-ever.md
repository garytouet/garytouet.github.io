Nick Bilton from the NY Times was present at the Google I/O conference. The company announced that the Google Glasses were available for pre-orders for software developers for $1,500. He explains:
<blockquote>Mr. Brin then began one of the most elaborate product announcements I’ve ever seen. He connected to a group of skydivers flying above San Francisco, who jumped out of the plane, wearing Google glasses and streaming their view as they plummeted to earth at 135 miles per hour. The skydivers landed successfully, thankfully, on the roof of the Moscone Center, where the Google I/O event is being held.

Like any good James Bond movie, it didn’t stop there. Stunt bicycles flipped in the air and people rappelled off the side of the building — all while wearing Google glasses.</blockquote>

How cool is that?
