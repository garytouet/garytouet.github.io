TorrentFreak:
<blockquote>For more than a decade the entertainment industry has claimed that digital piracy is the main cause for the gradual decline in revenues. So if piracy is <a href="http://www.telecompaper.com/news/french-online-music-worth-eur-110-mln-in-2011-study">down</a> massively in France, one would expect that the revenues are soaring, right? But they’re not.

If we look at the French music industry we see that overall revenues were down by 3.9 percent in 2011.</blockquote>

This is France centric, but there is no doubt this will reproduce in any other country.

The French government is using the taxpayers' money to support a dying industry with unsuccessful laws.

Voilà.
