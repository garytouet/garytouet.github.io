The New York Times reports:
<blockquote>In an acknowledgment of the realities of the digital age — and of competition from the Web site Wikipedia — Encyclopaedia Britannica will focus primarily on its online encyclopedias and educational curriculum for schools. The last print version is the 32-volume 2010 edition, which weighs 129 pounds and includes new entries on global warming and the Human Genome Project.</blockquote>

New business idea: create and sell fake-looking Britannica encyclopedia for people to show off.

Seriously, I am not surprised by the decision. The Internet made this inevitable. However, I had underestimated Wikipedia's competition.
