Sorry for the silence on the site. The past week has been both awesome and hectic. My days are separated between work and looking for a room to rent, so there is little time left to keep up with the tech news.

My RSS reader has been closed for almost a week now and the rare times I open my Twitter client are not enough to find something to write about.

Please be patient. Things should slow down a bit when I will have my room.

Meanwhile, here is a short video of the Sydney Opera House to make you wait. I shot it while taking the ferry for a ride by night.
