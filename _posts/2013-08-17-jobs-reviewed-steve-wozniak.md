Steve Wozniack actually commented on <a href="http://gizmodo.com/i-saw-the-movie-tonight-i-thought-the-acting-throughou-1153306973">Gizmodo's 'Jobs' review</a>. His comment has been republished by the site as an article:
<blockquote>I saw Jobs tonight. I thought the acting throughout was good. I was attentive and entertained but not greatly enough to recommend the movie. One friend who is in the movie said he didn't want to watch fiction so he wasn't interested in seeing it.

I suspect a lot of what was wrong with the film came from Ashton's own image of Jobs. Ashton made some disingenuous and wrong statements about me recently (including my supposedly having said that the 'movie' was bad, which was probably Ashton believing pop press headlines) and that I didn't like the movie because I'm paid to consult on another one. These are examples of Ashton still being in character. Either film would have paid me to consult, but the Jobs one already had a script written. I can't take that creative leadership from someone else. And I was turned off by the Jobs script. But I still hoped for a great movie.</blockquote>

I still can't decide if I'll go or not. The film could be a good entertainment as long as I don't expect the script to stick to reality.
