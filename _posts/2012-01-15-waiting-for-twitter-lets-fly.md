So after over five weeks, I still don't have access to the <a href="http://fly.twitter.com/">New New Twitter</a>.

Have I been relegated to the third world of web services because I don't have any smartphone?

Let's see what Twitter says:
<blockquote>Weâ€™ll be rolling out the redesigned Twitter over the next few weeks. You can see it immediately on the just-updated versions of mobile.twitter.com, Twitter for iPhone, and Twitter for Android. You can get early access on your computer by downloading and logging into Twitter for iPhone or Twitter for Android.</blockquote>

It's a 'Yes'.
