Jack Dorsey, Square's CEO, on the deal with Starbucks:

<blockquote>When Starbucks builds the Square Directory into their apps and in-store Digital Network, it gives Square new visibility, driving more customers to opt-in to Square. And with nearly 7,000 Starbucks stores soon accepting Square, these new payers will be able to find your business (including coffeehouses) and pay with their name, building community and creating value.</blockquote>

Starbucks is a big player and has a huge network. The deal will expose Square to a new audience, which will surely use <a href="https://squareup.com/pay-with-square">Pay With Square</a> in other stores too. It's also a convincing argument to sign up new retailers. It's a great deal for Square that puts him ahead of its competitors.

What an exciting company to work for.
