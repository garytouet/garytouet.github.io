I've a read a lot of articles this morning about the new Facebook Timeline for brand pages. No one was actually covering all the new features, so I started writing my own post with quotes from different sites highlighting the main things to remember, until I found this great article on Techcrunch. I ended up quoting them for each feature. No point doing that, so a direct link makes more sense.

You'll learn everything from the new cover image to the pin posts, highlights and possibility to hide posts as well as the new private messages and admin panel. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/author/josh-constine/">Josh Constine</a> also made a good job commenting and giving tips for a good use of the new features.
