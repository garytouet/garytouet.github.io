VentureBeat reports that Square added encryption to its little reader and most probably in response to competitors' criticism.

<blockquote>Competitor VeriFone <a href="http://www.sq-skim.com/">tried to drum up sentiment against Square</a> last year because Square’s readers did not encrypt credit card numbers from the reader to the application.

In the recent launch of PayPal’s competing product, PayPal Here, the company referenced popular unencrypted readers, while mentioning that its own dongle does encryption.</blockquote>

Even easier to trust Square's reader.
