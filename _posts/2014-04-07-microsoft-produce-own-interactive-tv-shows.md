Bloomberg reports that six series are in the line-up:
<blockquote>Microsoft Corp. is going Hollywood with a cast including comedians Sarah Silverman and Seth Green, aspiring World Cup players and eerily human robots.

All are involved in shows that Microsoft’s new Xbox television studio plans to roll out globally starting in June. Helmed by former CBS Corp. honcho Nancy Tellem, who Microsoft hired 19 months ago to build a TV powerhouse from the ground up, the studio now has six series lined up -- including a science-fiction thriller called “Humans” about humanoid robot workers -- and more than a dozen projects in development.</blockquote>

The TV shows are targeted at the current audience of XBOX owners, Tellem said:
<blockquote>“We aren’t trying to find something that’s going to be accepted by the largest common denominator, which is what a lot of people in the business look for,” she said. “We’re focused on what we feel our audience on our platform wants.”</blockquote>

Every show will be interactive:
<blockquote>The company is taking the unusual step of only greenlighting shows that can be combined with the interactive components to encourage users to engage across consoles, phones and tablets. By hiring a team of young Hollywood executives and pairing them with software engineers, Microsoft wants to finally crack a code that the entertainment and game industries have had trouble doing alone.</blockquote>

Curious to see what these interactive programs are going to look like.
