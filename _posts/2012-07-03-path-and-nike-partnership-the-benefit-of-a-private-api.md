Mike Isaac for AllThingsD about the recent update to the partnership, which adds Path support to the <a href="http://nikeplus.nike.com/plus/products/fuelband/" title="Nike FuelBand">Nike FuelBand</a>:
<blockquote>However small an update, it’s also an indicator of Path’s API partnership strategy as a whole. When Path first spoke of its API, the plan wasn’t to open it up to the masses — it was, and remains, a private API, with partners selected in terms of which ones make sense for the company to work with, and which ones make for a better user experience.</blockquote>

This is the kind of features I had in mind <a href="http://garytouet.com/2012/07/twitter-chose-the-advertising-path-instead-of-the-api-path/" title="Twitter chose the advertising path"> in my previous post about Twitter</a>. Twitter would become much more powerful with this kind of partnerships. I am note sure if the advertising path could lead to the same kind of power.
