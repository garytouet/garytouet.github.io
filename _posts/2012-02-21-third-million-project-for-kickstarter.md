Two weeks ago, <a href="http://garytouet.com/2012/02/kickstarter-crazy-24-hours/">Kickstarter lived an epic day</a> with two projects hitting $1M in pledges. 

Today, it strikes again with a third project hitting the impressive seven-figure amount: <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/599092525/the-order-of-the-stick-reprint-drive">The Order of the Stick Reprint Drive</a>.

That's a good sign of success. On top of that, two of the projects come from established artists, which gives a lot of credibility to Kickstarter for being a trusted funding platform.
