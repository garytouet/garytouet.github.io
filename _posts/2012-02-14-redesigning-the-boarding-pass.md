If you've ever taken a plane, you've had a boarding pass in your hands. If you're like me you realized how confusing these are, but never really thought how this could be improved.

This is when <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/tyler_thompson">Tyler Thompson</a> comes in the game. Unlike me, Tyler tried to figure out how boarding passes could become less confusing and helpful.

He dedicated a webpage to his attempt and intelligently added contributions from other designers to the reflexion.

It builds up a discussion both interesting and striking. There are still plenty of 'boarding passes' to reinvent.
