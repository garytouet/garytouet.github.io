Well-written post by <a href="http://tommymacwilliam.com/">Tommy</a>, an Harvard student obviously exposed to a lot of pretty smart people, about what we can learn from them.

It is definitely worth reading and what is to be remembered is the following:
<blockquote>Smart people don’t take claims at face value, and smart people don’t rest until they find an explanation they’re comfortable accepting and understanding.</blockquote>

Neither should you.
