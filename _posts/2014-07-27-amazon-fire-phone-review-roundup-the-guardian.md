The Guardian has gathered several excerpts from press reviews about the Fire Phone. Everything seems to be bad: battery life, temperature of the device being used, slow performance, very small number of apps available, gimmicky features such as Dynamic Perspective and Firefly.
The only aspect that seems good is the integration with Amazon's marketplace. At least, they did not fuck that up!
