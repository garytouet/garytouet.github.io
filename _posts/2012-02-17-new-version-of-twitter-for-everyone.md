On Twitter's blog:
<blockquote>In December, we launched a new version of Twitter. It’s been available for mobile phones, via the mobile web, Twitter for iPhone and Twitter for Android, and we’ve been rolling it out steadily to Twitter.com. Now, everyone has access to it.</blockquote>

So it took two months and close to ten days to Twitter to roll out this update.
