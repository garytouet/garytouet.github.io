I am not a big fan of Persols. I always find them very attractive when displayed in the shop. The front view is very simple and appealing to me, but once I look at the arms I always get disappointed. Persol's metal signature on the arms is too bright and shiny. I would feel too tacky wearing them. I would love to find a simple pair of glasses, no metal on the arms, no logo on the lenses and no pattern or shiny stuff anywhere. Maybe I should create my own brand.

Anyway, this is a very good video of demonstrating how Persol is manufacturing its glasses. It belongs to the great crafting videos flourishing on the Internet and it is a very good communication exercise for Persol.
