Mor Naaman suggesting that Apple should buy both Square and Foursquare:
<blockquote>To summarize: after the deal, Apple will immediately become a giant payments company, with an installation base that is expected to encompass <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-iphone-market-share-increasing-android-has-gone-flat-2012-3">half of all mobile devices</a> sold. The company will have the best local search abilities, far exceeding any existing recommendation engine. And due to its enormous reach, it will possess a payment system that merchants will line up to support. Whoâ€™s betting against this holy trinity? Not me.</blockquote>

I find it hard to believe. <a href="http://garytouet.com/2012/04/apple-could-enter-the-payment-business/">I can see how it makes sense for Apple to enter the payment business</a>, but I don't think they need to acquire Square to do so. Apple has the credit card info from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/02/apple-200-million-itunes-accounts/">over 200 million people</a>, they have experience in managing payments (iTunes and the different AppStores) plus they have millions of devices in the wild already. I guess they have enough talented engineers and designers to work on such a system rather than paying $4 billion for Square.

Now regarding Foursquare, what's the point? They could offer recommendations with a Square-like service anyway. Plus, isn't Foursquare a niche service? Most of the people I know use Facebook to check-in nowadays.
