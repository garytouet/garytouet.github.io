Techcrunch :
<blockquote>Square has <a href="http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/square-closes-series-d-financing-1702112.htm">announced</a> that it has finally closed its Series D round, totalling $200 million, with investors including Citi Ventures, Rizvi Traverse Management, and Starbucks Coffee Company. It values the mobile payments company started by Twitter’s Jack Dorsey at $3.25 billion, according to <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120917/square-finally-closes-200-million-round-at-blockbuster-valuation/">AllThingsD</a>.</blockquote>

We already knew Starbucks had invested $25 million when the deal between the companies was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/07/square-partnershi/">announced</a>.

Other interesting bit:
<blockquote>It also plans to announce its first non-U.S. services later this year, it says. A large part of its financing will be used to accelerate that expansion. A likely partner there will again be Starbucks, which has an extensive operation outside of the U.S., with 18,000 stores in 60 countries in total.

Starbucks’ CEO Howard Schultz has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/08/square-starbucks-qa/">already said</a> that expanding Square’s relationship to those locations is up to Square to greenlight.</blockquote>

I'm guessing the UK (same language, good smartphone adoption, probably fewer regulations on payments unlike other European countries, presence of <a href="http://garytouet.com/2012/05/izettle-looks-for-3000-beta-testers-in-the-uk/">competitors</a>), but I might be wrong. I'm secretly wishing it was France though.

The Starbucks deal is amazing to enter a new market.
