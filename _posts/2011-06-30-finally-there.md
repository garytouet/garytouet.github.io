Another quick note to tell you that after a day on transit I finally arrived yesterday in Sydney, Australia. The trip went well and I already had the chance to discover Sydney CBD and the Opera House.

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="{{ site.url }}/images/sydney-opera-house.jpg" alt="Sydney Opera House" title="sydney opera house.jpg" border="0" width="450" height="128" />


I can't wait to find out more about this city.
