Square's website:
<blockquote>Pay once a month to process all swiped transactions at 0% per swipe within the following limits: up to $400 per any single transaction and up to $250,000 in total transactions per yearâ€”or approximately $21,000 per month. Swiped transactions over these limits simply cost 2.75% per swipe.</blockquote>

Compelling argument to ditch the traditional plans with complicated fee structures and hidden costs. 

I see this as a move to target better established small businesses, not the individual doing several jobs per month, but the bigger shop/cafe/restaurant with daily business. $250 per month is nothing for them.
