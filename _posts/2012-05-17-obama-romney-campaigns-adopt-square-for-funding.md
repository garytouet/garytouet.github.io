<blockquote>On Monday, President Obama’s re-election campaign announced that it would immediately begin using Square, a mobile payments start-up company based in San Francisco, with campaign staffers and some approved volunteers. “Squares are being sent to our campaign offices across the country,” said Katie Hogan, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama’s re-election campaign.

[…]

Zac Moffatt, digital director for the Romney campaign, said the Romney team planned to experiment with the Square donation process “as a beta test” on Tuesday night during the primary election.</blockquote>

Square has even developed a special app for Obama's campaign. 

Very good deals for Square. The amount of people, who will be introduced to Square, is going to be astounding.
