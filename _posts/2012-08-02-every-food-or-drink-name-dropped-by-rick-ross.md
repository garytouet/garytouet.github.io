I love that kind of post. Rick Ross makes a good case. He sure likes his food.

It's worth skimming through the list, but I selected my favourite ones for you.

First, for its wisdom:
<blockquote>* Chocolate milk (“I’m Only Human”: He never knew chocolate milk make you fart real bad)</blockquote>

Second, for the originality and the rhyme. 

<blockquote>* Tea (“On Top of the World”: I watch ‘em snort a powder all while I’m chillin’ sippin tea/ Lemons and honey, millions and money)</blockquote>
