A really quick note, just to let you know that I'm flying tomorrow to Sydney. I'll be in the Australian city on the 29th of June.

As I've already written when <a href="http://garytouet.com/2011/05/granted-visa/">I got the visa</a>, this is the biggest step I've taken in my life and I hope I won't regret it.

All the habits and the familiar places I've known for a long time will now disappear. They will be replaced by new ones. However family and friends will be missed a lot. I already cried them even if I am still in France.

If you are in Sydney during the year to come and if you want to meet up with a French frog, please <a href="http://garytouet.com/contact/">contact me</a>. I'd be pleased to meet you.

See you soon!
