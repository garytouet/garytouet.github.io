Dan Frommer updated his chart after <a href="http://garytouet.com/2012/04/square-huge-move-businesses/">Square revealed it is processing payments at a $5 billion annualized rate</a>.

It is exciting to see this kind of curb and Square is exciting to watch overall. However, Dan made a comment I found interesting:
 <blockquote>Assuming Square’s published 2.75% commission, Square’s gross revenue run rate on $5 billion of annual payments is about $140 million. Square does make a margin from its commission, COO Keith Rabois told me last month.

But the company is far from profitable — on purpose, of course. Much of the commission goes to pay the credit card companies, which Square won’t be able to design out of the picture for a while. And with a staff of ~250, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-25/square-payment-pace-rises-25-in-niche-coveted-by-ebay.html">aiming to double to 500</a> this year, Square is spending tens of millions per year on employees.</blockquote>

Payment systems are so locked by big companies (Visa, Mastercard) that to actually make a difference you have to come in and accept to lose money. 

Hopefully, it won't last long.
