Ravi Udeshi on his blog:
<blockquote>I took the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/23/2896775/microsoft-store-windows-phone-challenge">“Smoked by Windows Phone” Challenge</a> yesterday. And won.

Or so I thought.

Instead, the store manager cited an employee mistake to deny me the prize, a $1000 laptop.</blockquote>

Looks like <a href="http://garytouet.com/2012/03/he-won-the-windows-phone-challenge-oh-wait-he-didnt/">another</a> Microsoft's employee does not like to lose.
