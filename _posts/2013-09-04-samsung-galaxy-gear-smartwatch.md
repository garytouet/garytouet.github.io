The Verge:
<blockquote>There are a couple of significant downsides that temper my enthusiasm for the new Gear. First and foremost is the speed and intuitiveness of the user interface â€” or rather, the lack thereof. There's a tangible lag to anything you do with the Gear, while the swipe gestures are hard to figure out and do different things depending on where you are in the menus.</blockquote>

Add to that a bad speaker, short battery life and a price at $299, what's incredibly great?

I get that it's the first release and that it is going to get better over time, but it certainly looks like something rushed out in case Apple comes out with a watch too.
