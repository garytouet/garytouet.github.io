Square has published on its <a href="https://vimeo.com/squareinc">Vimeo Channel</a> a 1-minute TVC. Besides giving details about the reader, the apps, the fees, it shows three small-business owners and how they use the service.

I think we found the <a href="http://garytouet.com/2012/04/square-advertising-on-tv/">TVC spotted</a> a few weeks ago. Nothing more to add. The focus is still on small-businesses and the convenience of the sevice.
