Ars Technica:
<blockquote>A bug quietly reported on September 1 appears to have grave implications for Android users. Android Browser, the open source, WebKit-based browser that used to be part of the Android Open Source Platform (AOSP), has a flaw that enables malicious sites to inject JavaScript into other sites. Those malicious JavaScripts can in turn read cookies and password fields, submit forms, grab keyboard input, or do practically anything else.</blockquote>

Google stopped using this browser in Android 4.2 Jelly Bean and replaced it with Chrome. It also stopped using core elements of this browser for web views within apps in Android 4.4 Kit Kat, but stats show it is still widely used:

<blockquote>Google's own numbers paint an even worse picture. <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html">According to the online advertising giant</a>, only 24.5 percent of Android users are using version 4.4. The majority of Android users are using versions that include the broken component, and many of these users are using 4.1.x or below, so they're not even using versions of Android that use Chrome as the default browser.</blockquote>

Moreover:
<blockquote>Just how this fix will be made useful is unclear. While Chrome is updated through the Play Store, the AOSP Browser is generally updated only through operating system updates. Timely availability of Android updates remains a sticking point for the operating system, so even if Google develops a fix, it may well be unavailable to those who actually need it.</blockquote>

It does not seem to trigger much fear or scandal around the web, surprisingly. Why?
