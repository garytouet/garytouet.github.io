Last week precisely, <a href="http://garytouet.com/2014/11/the-verge-reviews-the-nexus-9/" title="The Verge reviews the Nexus 9">I quoted The Verge's review of the Nexus 9</a>, specifically their overall feeling about the tablet and build quality. I added the following note:

<blockquote>Not that easy to build a convincing iPad competitor at the same price, it seems.</blockquote>

What was my surprise, when I read that one day after launch HTC cut the price by 50%.

Ars Technica:
<blockquote>We've seen widespread complaints about the new &quot;premium&quot; pricing strategy for the new Nexus devices, and to make matters worse, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/11/nexus-9-review-a-premium-tablet-with-a-not-so-premium-feel/" title="Ars Technica, Nexus 9 review">the Nexus 9</a> didn't really live up to the &quot;premium&quot; price. With a price cut this deep just a day after launch, we have to wonder if the Nexus 9 is really worth $400. On Google Play, the device is still going for $400, but this is definitely an eyebrow-raising move by HTC.

We were able to buy one and actually got a confirmation e-mail. We'll update this report should any new information on the situation become available.

<strong>Update:</strong> HTC <a href="https://twitter.com/HTCUSA/status/529684796750852096" title="HTC's tweet about the Nexus 9's price cut ">just tweeted</a> that it is &quot;working on something for everyone who missed out,&quot; which makes it sound like more price cuts are coming.</blockquote>

Shocking!
