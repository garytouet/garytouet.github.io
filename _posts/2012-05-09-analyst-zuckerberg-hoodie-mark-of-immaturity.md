<blockquote>“Mark and his signature hoodie: He’s actually showing investors he doesn’t care that much; he’s going to be him,” Pachter said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “I think that’s a mark of immaturity. I think that he has to realize he’s bringing investors in as a new constituency right now, and I think he’s got to show them the respect that they deserve because he’s asking them for their money.”</blockquote>

Should investors be more preoccupied by Zuckerberg's hoodie or by his projects for Facebook?

A suit would definitely make him more mature and better at managing Facebook. For sure…
