Wimpy, a South African fast food chain, with its ad agency <a href="http://www.metropolitanrepublic.co.za/">MetropolitanRepublic</a> found this very clever way to introduce their new braille menus.

How? They prepared 15 burgers and used the sesame seeds to create messages on the buns. They then distributed these burgers to blind institutions.

Great idea. Cheap. And their message has been relayed by very credible institutions to over 800,000 sight disabled people (according to their video).
