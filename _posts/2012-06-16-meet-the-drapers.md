Long but interesting article by Danielle Sacks at FastCompany about the Draper family, a long-standing Venture Capitalist family. 

<blockquote>Silicon Valley observers like TheFunded's Ressi says there's little guarantee that these Drapers can extend the Draper dynasty. "The only way you can have a dynasty in Silicon Valley is if every generation is exceptional," says Ressi. "You've had a unit of two with the Drapers, which is rare."</blockquote>

As we say in French about family businesses:
<blockquote>Le première génération la crée. La deuxième la développe. La troisième la tue.</blockquote>

<em>The first generation builds the business. The second develops it. The third kills it.</em>

<br />
We'll see.
