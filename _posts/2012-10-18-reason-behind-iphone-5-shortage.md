The Wall Street Journal:
<blockquote>“The iPhone 5 is the most difficult device that Foxconn has ever assembled.  To make it light and thin, the design is very complicated,” said an official at the company who declined to be named. “It takes time to learn how to make this new device. Practice makes perfect. Our productivity has been improving day by day.”

[…]

He admitted that the conflict between assembly line workers and quality inspectors at its Zhengzhou site last month was partly due to the metal casing and other “quality issues,” but he didn’t elaborate.</blockquote>

It surely is disappointing to take your iPhone 5 out of the box and observe scratches and dents. It should never happen, especially for such an expensive device.

However, this article and <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/10/17/foxconn-says-iphone-5-is-the-most-difficult-device-its-ever-assembled">others</a> have hurt my sensitivity. It's hard not to feel like a douche when complaining while Foxconn workers are hard at work in horrible conditions. I think I'll be fine with a little dent.

Saturday Night Live nailed this point in their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybDKfGEw4aU">video</a>.
