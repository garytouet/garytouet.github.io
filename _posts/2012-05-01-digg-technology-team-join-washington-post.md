Peter Kafka for AllThingsD:
<blockquote>The site was once one of Silicon Valley’s hottest Web 2.0 startups, and there was a period when lots of Web publishers spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to court Digg’s hordes of users. But that time is long gone (if you’re looking for a social/traffic kingmaker, head to Reddit, which used to be dismissed as a Digg wannabe).</blockquote>

Ironic.
