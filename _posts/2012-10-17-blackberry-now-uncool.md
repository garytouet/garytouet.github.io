NY Times:
<blockquote>“I’m ashamed of it,” said Ms. Crosby, a Los Angeles sales representative who said she had stopped pulling out her BlackBerry at cocktail parties and conferences. In meetings, she says she hides her BlackBerry beneath her iPad for fear clients will see it and judge her.</blockquote>

This paragraph is hilarious. It's fascinating to see how a phone formerly used by business people and loved by aspiring business people is now old-fashioned.

On another level, it's sad to see RIM doing poorly. As the NY Times reports:
<blockquote>The company’s future all depends on a much-delayed new phone coming next year; meanwhile RIM recorded a net loss of $753 million in the first half of the year compared with a profit of more than $1 billion a year earlier.</blockquote>

Around me it seems there isn't many Blackberry fans left.
