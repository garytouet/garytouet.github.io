GigaOm:
<blockquote>A former U.S. Department of Justice lawyer and antitrust expert says Facebook’s purchase of photo-sharing site Instagram will take between four months and one year to clear regulatory hurdles. In the meantime, the deal is effectively on hold.

[…]

If Facebook can have Instagram, it will be a leading player in photo sharing both online and on mobile. (See Om’s explanation <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/04/09/here-is-why-did-facebook-bought-instagram/">here)</a>.
