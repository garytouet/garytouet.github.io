Sarah Lacy, former Techcrunch's senior editor, introduces its new tech blog with great ambitions. She writes:
<blockquote>We have one goal here at PandoDaily: To be the site-of-record for that startup root-system and everything that springs up from it, cycle-after-cycle.</blockquote>

<a href="http://pandodaily.com/">PandoDaily</a> goes therefore straight to my RSS folder. We'll see how it evolves.

I wish Sarah and her team the best journey. I hope we are the beginning of something big.
