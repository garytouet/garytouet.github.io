It's surprising to see Apple apologize, but the most surprising bit certainly is this one. Tim Cook:
<blockquote>While weâ€™re improving Maps, you can try alternatives by downloading map apps from the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewFeature?id=566480009&mt=8">App Store</a> like Bing, MapQuest and Waze, or use Google or Nokia maps by going to their websites and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/add-to-home-screen/">creating an icon</a> on your home screen to their web app.</blockquote>

It's one thing to acknowledge shipping a deficient product, but it's another to point at competitors and explain how to use them.

It's honest and humble. It shows determination to offer the best experience whatsoever.
