Wired:
<blockquote>Apple on Tuesday ordered its support staff to immediately stop processing AppleID password changes requested over the phone, following the <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/">identity hacking of Wired reporter Mat Honan</a> over the weekend, according to Apple employees.</blockquote>
