The Other World Computing blog ran an experiment with the new Retina Macbook Pro:
<blockquote>Including the built-in Retina display, the new 2012 MacBook Pro 15″ can run four displays at their native resolution.

<ol>
<li>
Retina on laptop @ “best for Retina”</li>
<li>iMac used as a display @ 2560 x 1440 via Thunderbolt</li>
<li>iMac used as a display @ 2560 x 1440 via Thunderbolt/DisplayPort</li>
<li>LG monitor @ 1920 x 1200  via HDMI</li>
</ol>

Moving images and media didn’t create any lag and we were able to play video on all four displays simultaneously.</blockquote>

Impressive.
