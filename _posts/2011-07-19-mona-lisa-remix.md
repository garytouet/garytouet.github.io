<blockquote>Leonardo da Vinci's 'The Mona Lisa' reduced & remixed down into 140 exact circles of colour. Makes no sense close up. Makes every sense from the other side of the room.</blockquote>

It does not make any sense close up. Correct, but looking at a small thumbnail on your screen does make total sense. If you follow the link, you will see some. So no need to print it and to stick on your wall to see the magic happen.

When I look at it, I see an optical illusion. As if there were lines between the dots. This is what makes the trick, I believe!
