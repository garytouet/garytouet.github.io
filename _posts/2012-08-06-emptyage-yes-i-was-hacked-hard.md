Mat Honan:
<blockquote>So maybe you saw my Twitter going nuts tonight. Or you saw Gizmodo’s Twitter account blow up. Or you saw <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120803/gizmodo-twitter-account-hijacked-by-foul-mouthed-hackers/">this in AllThingsD</a>. Or <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/clan-vv3-gizmodo-twitter-hack/">this in the DailyDot</a>. Although embarrassing, Twitter was the least of it. In short, someone gained entry to my iCloud account, used it to remote wipe all of my devices, and get entry into other accounts too. </blockquote>

His story freaked me out. At a lower scale, it made me realize how scary it is to know that you can't access your accounts while someone with mean intentions can.

<strong>Update:</strong> Mat added several updates to his post, in particular this interesting one:

<blockquote><strong>Update Three:</strong> I know how it was done now. Confirmed with both the hacker and Apple. It wasn’t password related. They got in via Apple tech support and some clever social engineering that let them bypass  security questions. Apple has my Macbook and is trying to recover the data. I’m back in all my accounts that I know I was locked out of. Still trying to figure out where else they were.</blockquote>

Hopefully, Apple will look into it and change its policy.
