Jonathan Rauch for the Atlantic wrote a nice piece about what it means to be an introvert in a world full of extroverts:

<blockquote>With their endless appetite for talk and attention, extroverts also dominate social life, so they tend to set expectations. In our extrovertist society, being outgoing is considered normal and therefore desirable, a mark of happiness, confidence, leadership. Extroverts are seen as bighearted, vibrant, warm, empathic. "People person" is a compliment. Introverts are described with words like "guarded," "loner," "reserved," "taciturn," "self-contained," "private"â€”narrow, ungenerous words, words that suggest emotional parsimony and smallness of personality. Female introverts, I suspect, must suffer especially.</blockquote>

Disclaimer: I consider myself as an introvert and I enjoyed this article. However, we don't need yet another movement such as the Introverts' Rights movement Rauch mentions, in my opinion. We don't need words like "shy", "reserved', etc. to be banned because they are somewhat disrespectful to introverted little kids. Worse, I hope introverts will never feel the need to exist by picturing themselves as discriminated victims of a world dominated by extroverts.

It's good to learn about introversion. It's especially good for extroverts to know their counterparts better, but please no need to find another criteria to categorise people. I'm not saying that's what the article proposes, just that it could be a temptation for certain.
