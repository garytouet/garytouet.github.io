title: Historic day
---

It is mostly a historic day because France (where I'm from) has, after 55 days of lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic, eased the restrictions today. [France is among other countries to have done so](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52615733).

Let's remember that French people needed to write their own authorisations before leaving their homes during this lockdown period. This is now over. In Germany, where I've been living since 2015, this was not necessary.

From the aforelinked BBC article:
> People will no longer need travel permits to explain why they have left home. Car journeys of up to 100km (60 miles) from home are allowed, but drivers need permission for distances further than that.

It is also a historic day for this website since, after almost three years of hiatus (exactly 2 years 10 months and 1 day), I am posting here once again. Strange times.

While typing these lines, I looked at the date of my previously last post with disbelief. It was posted in 2017, two years after my move to Berlin, Germany. This is what I have a hard time believing. Posting on this website is so strongly associated with my student years in my memory. As the [archive page](/archives/) reveals, 2011 and especially 2012 were my most active years. I started while in my third year of studies and from mid-2011 to mid-2012, I wrote from Sydney, Australia where I worked and studied too. I do not recall at all posting from Berlin.

Anyway, the stay-at-home measures have made aspects of my life look like my old student life again. The balance has shifted and, like before, most of my occupations are at home now. My life has slowed down too. The outside world's call for my attention is limited. I'm left with more energy and more time to spend on fulfilling occupations at home.

I guess it's fitting that, today, my mind decided to release this website from its lockdown and re-opened it.
