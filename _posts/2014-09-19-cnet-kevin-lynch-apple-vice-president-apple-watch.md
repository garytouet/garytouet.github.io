CNET's introduction:
<blockquote>The exec, who clashed with Apple while at Adobe, now runs the team working on wearable software at Apple -- a vital role as the company expands into a new business.
</blockquote>

Fascinating that Apple chose to trust him with Apple Watch even though he had been so critical of its stance on Flash. You would think this would directly disqualify him as potential hire. It seems rather intelligent for Apple to see past that and recognise talent above everything else.
