Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for ZDNet:
<blockquote>I’m now ready to sum up my Windows 8 experience with a single word: <strong>awful</strong>.

[…]

I just can’t shake the feeling that Windows 8 would be better off as two separate operating systems. A ‘classic’ Windows 8 for regular desktop and notebook systems - which would feel more like a service pack for Windows 7 than a full release — and a separate ‘Metro’ version for touch-enabled hardware.</blockquote>

This confirms what many have been saying. The Metro interface seems to be to hard to use on a desktop. It seems to be suited for tablets though. Separating the two interfaces would probably be more usable.

I still give Windows 8 the benefice of the doubt. I'll wait until I use it to make a real judgment, but I may test it with a bias.
