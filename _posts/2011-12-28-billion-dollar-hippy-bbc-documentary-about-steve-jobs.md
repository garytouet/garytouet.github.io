That's an hour well spent, if you ask me.

There is nothing really new for the nerds, but the angle taken by the BBC is interesting. The documentary is focused on Apple's successes seen through Steve Jobs' hippy past.

We read a lot about his childhood these days and how feeling he had been chosen by his adoptive parents rather than given had a decisive impact on him. I guess it's true, but I don't think it's sufficient to explain his success. It shaped his personality for sure and how he was with people, but it did not give him a vision. What did was his hippy experiences and <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/10/steve_jobs_implied_that_taking_lsd_made_him_more_creative_does_t.html">everything that goes with it</a>.
