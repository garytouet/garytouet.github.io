The Verge:
<blockquote>The Withings Activité is a watch. A Swiss Made watch, much like the ones we've been wearing for decades — only slightly smarter. At $450, it's a serious purchase, an investment in quality. Now Withings has tweaked the formula a bit. The Activité Pop, which was just announced at CES 2015, is a $149.95 wristwatch made more for the Timex wearer.

The Pop comes in three colors: Azure, Shark Gray, and Sand. Which is to say it comes in black, blue, and beige. (There are other strap colors, too.) You won't find &quot;Swiss Made&quot; anywhere on these devices, because they're not nearly as high-end as the Activité; they're made of PVD-coated metal, a standard material in many mid-range watches, along with a silicone strap. The watch is water-resistant up to 30 meters, and its battery lasts up to eight months.</blockquote>

Withings follows up on its <a href="http://garytouet.com/2014/12/the-verge-withings-activite-review/" title="Withings Activité Review">Activité</a> with a cheaper model, but still good-looking.
