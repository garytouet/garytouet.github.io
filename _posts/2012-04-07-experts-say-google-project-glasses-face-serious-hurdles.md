You've probably seen <a href="https://plus.google.com/111626127367496192147/posts">Google's Project glass concept video</a>. It looks cool, but it does not take into account current technology limitations.

As experts told Wired:
<blockquote>Mistry does point out that the Project Glass demo is a concept video. But MacIntyre believes Google may have set the bar too high for itself. “In one simple fake video,” MacIntyre told Wired, “Google has created a level of over-hype and over-expectation that their hardware cannot possibly live up to.”</blockquote>

It's a tough task for Google. Of course, they want to create excitement. A realistic video probably would have deceived. It's not guaranteed that it would have been shared as much. But isn't it more harmful to create expectations Google won't be able to meet?
