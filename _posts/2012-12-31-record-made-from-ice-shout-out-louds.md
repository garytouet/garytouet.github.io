DesignBoom:
<blockquote>indie band the <a href="http://www.shoutoutlouds.com/">shout out louds</a> have released their latest single in a very limited edition 7-inch record that plays on ice. 'blue ice' is the first piece of music 
the group has released for the past three years and is the first single off the band's upcoming, as-yet-untitled, full-length album. 
the unique frosty vinyl was created in collaboration with ad agency <a href="http://www.tbwa.se/nyheter/l">TBWA stockholm</a>, and through experimentation, was created using distilled water to avoid bubbles in the tracks. the records can be spun on a regular turntable and rapidly diminish in quality once the melting process begins, 
so a specialized silicone cast allowed for quick removal out of the freezer and instant tunes and be heard.</blockquote>

Useless, but cool. Efficient though to get coverage from blogs, many tweets and to spread the word about the album coming out.
