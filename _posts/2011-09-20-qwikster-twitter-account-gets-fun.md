This is hilarious.

Greg Kumparak writes for Techcrunch:
<blockquote>Netflix made a rather fundamental mistake in launching <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/18/netflix-qwikster/">their new spin-off brand</a>, Qwikster: they didn’t make sure they had the name locked down on all of the big social networks before making the announcement.

[…]

After over a month of silence, Jason’s @Qwikster account sprang back to life just a few hours ago and, likely to Netflix’s horror, has been more active today than it ever was before. Jason keeps touching on the idea of selling the account between poetic bursts like “I’m about to go play soccer n I got stug by a fucken bee” and “I just got scared I went into the shower turned on the water n then stuff started falling I was lik omg wtf lol”</blockquote>

Netflix was probably expecting it could claim the name as the account was inactive, but they should have done it before actually announcing Qwikster…

However, this may get much funnier in a couple of days:
<blockquote>Someone should probably tell Jason that selling Twitter handles is strictly against Twitter’s <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/82759-squat-de-nom">Terms Of Service</a>, and attempts to do so can quickly result in the banhammer being dropped. Then Qwikster gets their name, free of charge.</blockquote>

Nice.
