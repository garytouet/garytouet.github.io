The Instagram Blog:
<blockquote>Today, we’re thrilled to introduce Video on Instagram and bring you another way to share your stories. When you go to take a photo on Instagram, you’ll now see a movie camera icon. Tap it to enter video mode, where you can take up to fifteen seconds of video through the Instagram camera.</blockquote>

Facebook is obviously going after <a href="https://vine.co">Vine, the Twitter video-sharing app</a>.
