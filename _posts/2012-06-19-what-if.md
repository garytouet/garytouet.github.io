If we evolved from small organisms to the type of humans we are now and if our brain evolved in such a way that we developed languages, built villages, families and complicated systems, what are the chances that another form of life on Earth evolves and starts doing the same?

What would happen to us? What would we do? Would we kill them?

I think I might have a million-dollar movie idea, here.
