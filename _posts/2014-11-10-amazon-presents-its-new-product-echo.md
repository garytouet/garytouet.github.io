Amazon:
<blockquote>Amazon Echo is designed around your voice. It's always onâ€”just ask for information, music, news, weather, and more. Echo begins working as soon as it hears you say the wake word, &quot;Alexa.&quot; It's also an expertly-tuned speaker that can fill any room with immersive sound.</blockquote>

Watching the video will give you a better understanding of what  the Echo is.

I guess Amazon is being very subtle about the Echo though. They focus on information-based features, when they only want to put this device in your living-room so you buy more from them. It certainly looks kind of cool in the video, but I cannot figure out who is going to buy this. I'm curious to see, as always, what the first reviews are going to say about the voice recognition capabilities and hardware quality too.
