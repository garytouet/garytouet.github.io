Just before the <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/03/18Apple-Conference-Call.html">conference call</a>, Apple issued a <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/03/19Apple-Announces-Plans-to-Initiate-Dividend-and-Share-Repurchase-Program.html">press release</a>. Techcrunch notes:

<blockquote>Apple plans to pay shareholders a dividend of $2.65 per share sometime in Q4 2012, which for Apple begins this July. In case you were wondering, the last time Apple paid dividends was in 1995 â€” shareholders got a whopping $0.12 per share.</blockquote>
