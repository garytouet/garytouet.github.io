That's an interesting video by the Verge of <a href="http://cubify.com/">Cubify's 3D printer</a>. 3D-printing is still at its early stages, but the final results are actually pretty good. It's still expensive for consumers, but there is no doubt 3D printing will be more accessible in the future.

Now my question is. When you see what the entertainment industry is trying to do to the Internet to address online piracy (<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/10/house-takes-senates-bad-internet-censorship-bill-makes-it-worse.ars">SOPA</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/10/house-takes-senates-bad-internet-censorship-bill-makes-it-worse.ars">ACTA</a>, HADOPI, etc.), what are goods manufacturers going to do when people will share 3D models of their products to print at home? When a search for an iPhone case 3D plan will be as easy as downloading a song? When they'll have to face the competition of creative people proposing their awesome models for free?

You know what, I'm worried.
